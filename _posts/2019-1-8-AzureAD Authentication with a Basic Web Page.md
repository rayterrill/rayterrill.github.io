title:  "AzureAD Authentication with a Basic Web Page"
tags: [ad, webdev]

Microsoft has published how to use the Javascript ADAL library to protect a SPA with AzureAD authentication [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-javascript-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi), but I personally found it a little difficult to use.

For that reason, I took that code and greatly simplified it (especially helpful when helping teach others how to use it!), and published that in a separate repo: [https://github.com/rayterrill/AzureADADALv1Example](https://github.com/rayterrill/AzureADADALv1Example).

Hope someone finds it useful!
